//The term "controller" comes from the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
// architectural pattern, widely used in the development of web
// applications. MVC is a way to organize your code to separate
// the concerns of managing different types of tasks. The pattern
// divides the application into three interconnected components,
// making it easier to manage complexity and development:
//
// 1. **Model:** Represents the shape of the data and business
// logic. It maintains the data of the application. The model
// does not concern itself with information about the user
// interface or how that data is presented to the user.
//
// 2. **View:** Represents the UI of the application, composed
// of all the things the user can see and interact with. Its
// responsibility is to display the data provided by the model
// in a specific format.
//
// 3. **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the model
// and the view. It listens to the user input (through the view),
// processes the user's data with the help of model objects, and
// returns the output display to the user (through the view). In
// a web application, a controller can manage the logic for different
// HTTP requests (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and is responsible
// for responding to the user input and perform interactions on the
// data model objects.
//
// The controller you're asking about is specifically for handling
// operations related to "books" in an application. This might include
// creating a new book, updating existing book information, deleting a
// book, or fetching book details. It processes requests, performs
// necessary logic or interactions with the data (model), and decides
// what response to send back (e.g., an HTML page, JSON data, etc.),
// often by rendering a view. Controllers play a crucial role in managing
// the flow of data in MVC-based applications, ensuring a clean separation
// between the application's technical architecture and the business logic.
